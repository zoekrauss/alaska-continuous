This repository acts as a summary of the work produced for the 2022 Univ of Washington eScience Institute Winter Incubator Program.

## Machine-learning-based detection of offshore earthquakes

Project lead: Zoe Krauss, graduate student, School of Oceanography  
eScience Liaison: Scott Henderson

The project description can be found at this link: https://escience.washington.edu/winter-2022-incubator-projects/  






An example of running the workflow, including downloading continuous offshore seismic data, preprocessing, applying the pre-trained machine learning network, and evaluating its performance can be found in the EXAMPLE.ipynb.


Resources to deploy this workflow on the cloud, using Azure, can be found in the following repository:
https://github.com/Denolle-Lab/azure

The next step in this project is to retrain the machine learning networks using offshore data. The repository where this work is beginning is here (very much still in the development phase):
